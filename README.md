# Underwater_image_enhancement

I have developed a trainable module using tensorflow that leverages evolutionary algorithms optimization capability to deep neaural networks and CNN's to enhance the underwater images 
Below are the comaprisions of images enhanced using the above module connected to UWCNN network https://github.com/saeed-anwar/UWCNN.git
